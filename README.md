# Magic Home Control

A Python-based GUI application to control smart WiFi LED bulbs using the `flux_led` library. The application provides a system tray icon, a graphical interface to manage and control connected bulbs, and the ability to save and load device configurations.

## 📌 Status

🚧 **Work in Progress**

## Features
- **System Tray Control:** Run the app from the system tray with quick actions.
- **GUI for Device Management:** Add, remove, and manage smart bulbs.
- **Color and Brightness Adjustment:** Change bulb colors and brightness dynamically.
- **Bulk Control:** Turn all bulbs on or off at once.
- **Persistent Device Storage:** Saves device configurations in a CSV file.
- **Connection Testing:** Check connectivity to bulbs before saving them.
